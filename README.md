# CDA

Create HL7-CDA (tm) documents in PHP.

This library has some Australian CDA Extensions enabled.  
This library is a work in progress and does not currently provide full CDA coverage.

## Usage

To see how to use the library check out the tests folder.  [ClinicalDocument_test](tests/ClinicalDocument_test.php) and [NCTIS_test](tests/NCTIS_test.php)
 are good starting points.


### Manage references

Each `ClinicalDocument` has its own `ReferenceManager`, which help to manage references across documents.

`ReferenceType` may be added on some elements to create a reference :

```
$doc = new ClinicalDocument();

$refManager = $doc->getReferenceManager();

// create an element 'element' which may have a reference

$element->setReference($refManager->getReferenceType('my_reference'));
// will create <element ID="my_reference">blabla</element>

// add the reference in a text

$text->setText($refManager->getReferenceElement('my_reference'));
// will create <text><reference value="my_reference" /></text>

```
## Run tests

1. Run composer to load phpunit and build autoload :

```
composer install
```

2. Run tests

```
you might see the the file phpunit-debug in the tests, the file sets up command line debugging for intellij:
export XDEBUG_CONFIG="idekey=phpstorm-xdebug";
phpunit $@

tests are structured so you can run the tests per group.  look for the @group docblock in each test file.

```

## Version History

### Version 1.0.0
This version has undergone significant refactoring and has had many more tags implemented. There has been some 
customisation to the Australian context.  The [NCTIS_test](tests/NCTIS_test.php) implements the code examples for 
an event summary CDA document.

In this version there is now a lot better checking of tag attributes such as moodCodes, classCodes, TypeCodes.  These 
acceptable codes are enumerated  in their Interfaces.  Check out [ClassCodeInterface](lib/Interfaces/ClassCodeInterface.php) 
for an example. The possible attributes for each tag are derived from the schema documents and set using the 
setAcceptable< Attribute >Codes methods.

PHP Traits have been used extensively to improve the code-styling/readability and to reduce unnecessary code duplication.

Note that while every effort was made to maintain compatibility with the previous version some changes were required,
and some breaking changes were made.
